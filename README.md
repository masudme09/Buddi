# Buddi - The Utility Tool
This is a utility tool for day to education in mind. Requirements of this application is raised from my thesis on open and accessible education with Virtual Reality.
However, this application should be useful as a web application while outside the VR environment as well. Features of this application as follows:
- Take, Edit and Share text notes (sharing is WIP)
- Keep image or screenshot as a image note, manage and share them (WIP)
- Take voice notes by recording voice and manage them (WIP)
- Chat with fellow students and institution users (WIP)
- Collaborate and brain storming (WIP)
- Learn basic programing by solving puzzles (WIP)

This repository is made from my thesis repository to managae it better. Old repository that contains my other thesis materials can be found here: https://github.com/masudme09/VR4EducationGodot
